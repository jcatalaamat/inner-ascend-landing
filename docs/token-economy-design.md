# Inner Ascend Token Economy Design

## Vision
A biased social media token economy where universal basic income meets contribution rewards in a closed-loop healing ecosystem.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Universal Basic Income (UBI)** - Earn tokens for being present in the community
2. **Contribution Rewards** - Earn more tokens by serving, creating, facilitating
3. **Internal Economy** - Spend tokens within the app (no external extraction)
4. **Community Governance** - Token holders vote on platform direction
5. **Priority Access** - Tokens grant visibility, retreat access, and other benefits

---

## Token Name: $INNER

**Why $INNER?**
- Represents inner work, inner ascension
- Short, memorable, brandable
- Aligns with "Inner Ascend" name

---

## Earning Tokens

### 1. Universal Basic Income (UBI)
**Everyone earns tokens just for being:**

| Activity | Token Reward | Frequency |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Daily login | 5 $INNER | Per day |
| Weekly check-in | 25 $INNER | Per week |
| Monthly presence | 100 $INNER | Per month |
| Profile completion | 50 $INNER | One-time |
| Bio update | 10 $INNER | Per update |

**Total UBI: ~300-500 $INNER/month for basic presence**

### 2. Contribution Rewards
**Earn more by serving the community:**

#### Facilitators
| Activity | Token Reward |
|----------|--------------|
| Host healing circle | 200 $INNER |
| 1-on-1 session | 100 $INNER |
| Create course module | 500 $INNER |
| Mentor facilitator-in-training | 300 $INNER |
| Respond to community question | 10 $INNER |

#### Participants
| Activity | Token Reward |
|----------|--------------|
| Attend healing circle | 20 $INNER |
| Complete course module | 30 $INNER |
| Write reflection/journal entry | 15 $INNER |

### 3. Reputation Multipliers
**Long-term participants earn more:**

| Apprentice (3-6 months) | 1.25x | Consistent presence |
| Practitioner (6-12 months) | 1.5x | Active contribution |
| Teacher (12-24 months) | 1.75x | Facilitating regularly |

## Staking Tokens

**Stake tokens to show commitment and earn benefits:**

### 1. Facilitator Staking
| Commitment | Stake Required | Benefits |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| Become facilitator-in-training | 1,000 $INNER | Access to training, mentorship |
| List as active facilitator | 2,000 $INNER | Profile visibility, booking access |
| Verified expert | 5,000 $INNER | Top ranking, trust badge |

**Staked tokens are locked but can be unstaked (with 30-day cooldown)**

### 2. Governance Staking
| Role | Stake Required | Benefits |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Voter | 100 $INNER | Vote on proposals |
| Proposer | 500 $INNER | Submit proposals |
| Council member | 5,000 $INNER | Vetted decision-making group |

### 3. Yield for Stakers
**Staked tokens earn passive income:**
- 5% APY for staked tokens
- Paid from community pool (see Token Supply below)

---

## Token Supply & Sustainability

### Initial Supply
- **10,000,000 $INNER** minted at launch
- Distribution:
  - 40% (4M) - Community rewards pool (UBI + contributions)
  - 30% (3M) - Founding team (vested over 4 years)
  - 20% (2M) - Early members (airdrop for first 1,000 members)
  - 10% (1M) - Reserve for partnerships, grants, emergencies

### Inflation / Deflation
**Inflationary (New tokens minted):**
- 5% annual inflation to fund ongoing UBI
- New tokens minted monthly and added to rewards pool

**Deflationary (Tokens burned):**
- 10% of tokens spent on services are burned (removed from circulation)
- Burned tokens reduce supply, increase scarcity

**Net effect:** Moderate inflation (3-4% annually) to ensure UBI sustainability

### Community Pool Management
- Governed by token holders
- Monthly budget voted on by community
- Transparent on-chain accounting

---

## Governance System

### Decision Types

#### 1. Small Decisions (App Features)
- Example: "Should we add dark mode?"
- Vote weight: 1 token = 1 vote
- Quorum: 10% of token holders
- Passes with simple majority (>50%)

#### 2. Medium Decisions (Platform Direction)
- Example: "Should we launch a physical retreat center?"
- Vote weight: 1 token = 1 vote, but reputation multiplier applies
- Quorum: 25% of token holders
- Passes with 60% majority

#### 3. Large Decisions (Economic Changes)
- Example: "Should we change UBI rate?"
- Vote weight: Quadratic voting (sqrt of tokens held)
- Quorum: 50% of token holders
- Passes with 75% majority

### Quadratic Voting
**Why?** Prevents whales from dominating governance
- If you hold 100 tokens, your vote weight = sqrt(100) = 10
- If you hold 10,000 tokens, your vote weight = sqrt(10,000) = 100
- Rich members have more influence, but not proportionally more

### Proposal Process
1. **Submit proposal** (costs 100 $INNER, refunded if approved)
2. **Discussion period** (7 days)
3. **Voting period** (7 days)
4. **Execution** (if passed)

## Technical Implementation

### Option 1: Internal Token (Recommended for MVP)
**Database-based, not blockchain:**

**Pros:**
- Simple to build
- No crypto stigma
- Full control over economy
- Fast transactions
- No gas fees

**Cons:**
- Centralized (you control it)
- Could be shut down
- Not "true" web3

**Tech stack:**
- PostgreSQL database for token balances
- Redis for transaction queue
- Node.js backend for token logic
- React frontend for wallet UI

### Option 2: Blockchain Token (Future)
**Real crypto on Ethereum, Polygon, or Solana:**

**Pros:**
- Decentralized (can't be shut down)
- Permissionless (anyone can build on it)
- True community ownership
- Composable with other web3 apps

**Cons:**
- Regulatory risk (SEC, securities law)
- Technical complexity
- Crypto stigma (some people hate crypto)
- Gas fees (expensive on Ethereum)

**Tech stack:**
- Solidity smart contracts
- Hardhat for development
- OpenZeppelin for security
- Web3.js or Ethers.js for frontend
- MetaMask or WalletConnect for user wallets

### Recommended Path
1. **Phase 1 (0-1,000 members):** Internal token, database-based
2. **Phase 2 (1,000-10,000 members):** Hybrid (internal token + governance NFT)
3. **Phase 3 (10,000+ members):** Full blockchain migration

## Anti-Gaming Mechanisms

### Prevent Abuse
| Exploit | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| Fake accounts for UBI | Email + phone verification |
| Spam comments for tokens | Reputation system + mod review |
| Self-voting | Can't vote on own proposals |
| Token farming | Rate limits on earning |
| Market manipulation | Tokens non-transferable outside app |

### Human Verification
- Email + phone required for UBI
- Reputation score affects earning multiplier
- Moderators can flag suspicious activity
- Machine learning to detect patterns

---

## Legal & Regulatory

### Is This a Security?
**Probably not, if:**
- Tokens are used for access, not investment
- No promise of profit
- Community-governed, not centrally controlled
- Utility token, not equity token

**To be safe:**
- Consult crypto lawyer
- Don't call it an "investment"
- Emphasize utility (access, governance)
- Avoid secondary markets

### Tax Implications
**For members:**
- Earned tokens = income (probably)
- Spent tokens = consumption (probably)
- Need to track cost basis

**For platform:**
- You're facilitating transactions, not selling securities (probably)
- Consult tax lawyer

## FAQ

**Q: Is this crypto?**
A: Not yet. It's an internal token system. We may migrate to blockchain in the future.

**Q: Can I cash out my tokens?**
A: No. Tokens stay within the Inner Ascend ecosystem. This is a closed-loop economy.

**Q: What if I run out of tokens?**
A: You earn UBI just for being here. You'll always have tokens.

**Q: Can I buy more tokens?**
A: Yes, through your monthly membership (€22 = 300 tokens). But you can also earn them by contributing.

**Q: Who controls the token supply?**
A: Initially, the founding team. Eventually, the community through governance.

**Q: What if the platform shuts down?**
A: Tokens would become worthless (for now). If we migrate to blockchain, tokens would persist.

**Q: Is this a pyramid scheme?**
A: No. There's no recruitment requirement, no upline/downline, no promise of profit.

**Q: Can I sell my tokens to someone else?**
A: No. Tokens are non-transferable outside the app.

## Next Steps

1. **Build MVP:** Internal token system with UBI + basic rewards
2. **Test with 100 members:** See how economy behaves
3. **Iterate:** Adjust rates, add features, fix exploits
4. **Launch publicly:** Open to all members
5. **Governance:** Hand over control to community
